# Stay-Sheathed-Lite
Just a small simple script to check and make sure your weapon remains sheathed.

<p>Small addon I thought I might as well share that sheaths your weapon. It's a very simple script and likely incompatible with Stay Unsheathed / Sheath. It doesn't have any extra options or customisation, so use one of the others if that's what you want.</p>

<p>Sometimes it goes into a sort of "ending loop" for hunters. idk why.</p>
<p><strong>TBC Classic</strong>: Because of how WoW handles sheath in olden times, it'll sheath and bring out your ranged/thrown/wand weapon or whatnot. I have it do a "double check" to try and also sheath that as well.</p>

<p><em>Maybe future idea:</em></p>
<p><em>Add ability for quick slash command that will temporarily stop sheathing function.</em></p>
